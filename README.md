## Description 
In this exercise we explore a common scenario in eCommerce, adding and removing items from the cart, and calculating the total. 

- A user can view a selection of items in the store 
- From the store, a user can add an item to their cart 
- From the cart, a user can view and adjust the number of items in their cart 
- If an item's quantity equals zero it is removed from the cart 
- A user can view the current total in their cart Instructions 
- Use this template as a starting point => https://codesandbox.io/s/js-exercise-greengrocer-template-grqi6 - Use data structures to store your data 
- Create render functions to work with the data 
- Create action functions to update your data (for the Cart section) 

## Tips 
- Use action functions with your Event Listeners, these will have names like addItemToCart and removeItemFromCart 

## Challenge 
1 - Add filters to the store ie. filter by item type; when a user clicks a filter they will only see items of that type Challenge 
2 - Add sorting to the store ie. sort by price or sort alphabetically; when a user clicks sort they will see a sorted list of items
